# boron

This repository contains 3 main folders:

1) working_code
--contains scripts that are the lastest versions of the boron proxy system model for general applications 

2) plotting
--contains scripts used for plotting jags output of the boron proxy system model for general applications 

3) Harperetal_2024_PNAS
--files for Harper et al. (2024) PNAS, late Paleocene - early Eocene reconstruction; contains 3 subfolders: 

-data: houses any input data including observational datasets and carbon cycle model output and reconstructions used for prior information. This folder also contains the supplemental data tables from the paper.

-code: sequential .R scripts which can be used to reproduce the study results and "_..." scripts which contain versions of the proxy system model used by JAGS.

-out_primary: proxy system model posteriors and their associated ages (in ka) reported in the paper with means, standard deviations, and quantiles used to determine credible intervals.
